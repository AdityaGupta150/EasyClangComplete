ClangAutoComplete
=================

Sublime Text 3 plugin that offers auto-completion of C/C++ structure members or class attributes and methods.


Installation

1. Install "clang".
2. Clone this repository and put it in your Sublime's packages directory.
3. Edit the settings to your needs.
4. Make sure Sublime's own auto-complete settings are properly configured, I've had trouble with mine.

Settings

include_dirs: List of directories where relevant header files are located
selectors: List of characters that will trigger auto-completion.
